  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following traits define an item `new`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
          candidate #1: `UserData`
          candidate #2: `PtrWrapper`
          candidate #3: `gdnative::prelude::GodotObject`
          candidate #4: `parking_lot_core::thread_parker::ThreadParkerT`
          candidate #5: `ahash::HashMapExt`
          candidate #6: `ahash::HashSetExt`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `NativeClass` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
