//! # Rust bindings for the Godot game engine
//!
//! This crate contains high-level wrappers around the core types of Godot Engine's GDNative
//! API, and the NativeScript feature which enables Rust code to be used as scripts.
//!
//! ## Memory management for core types
//!
//! Wrappers for most core types expose safe Rust interfaces, and it's unnecessary to mind
//! memory management most of the times. The exceptions are `VariantArray` and `Dictionary`,
//! internally reference-counted collections with "interior mutability" in Rust parlance. These
//! types are modelled using the "typestate" pattern to enforce that the official
//! [thread-safety guidelines][thread-safety]. For more information, read the type-level
//! documentation for these types.
//!
//! Since it is easy to expect containers and other types to allocate a copy of their
//! content when using the `Clone` trait, some types do not implement `Clone` and instead
//! implement [`NewRef`](object::NewRef) which provides a `new_ref(&self) -> Self` method
//! to create references to the same collection or object.
//!
